# Customer Segmentation using k-means clustering



## Problem Statement

Welcome to the Mall Customer Segmentation project, where we embark on a journey to categorize customers based on their shopping habits. In the bustling world of retail, understanding your customers is the key to unlocking a treasure trove of opportunities. By leveraging the power of Python, we analyze a dataset containing essential customer attributes like Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. Our mission is to uncover the secrets behind customer preferences and spending behavior, enabling businesses to create personalized shopping experiences that delight every shopper.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Import the dataset containing customer information including Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
- Step 2 : Performed an initial exploration to understand the data's structure and summary statistics.

- Step 3 : Created plots to analyze Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, gender distribution, customer age groups, spending score ranges, and the relationship between Annual Income and Spending Score.
         
- Step 4 : Performed K-means clustering using Age and Spending Score, Annual Income and Spending Score, and all features. Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method (WCSS) and visualized the clusters for each combination of features using scatter plots.
- Step 5 : Visualized the clusters in a 3D plot considering Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
